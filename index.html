        <h1>Earth's Moon</h1>
        <p>The fifth largest moon in the solar system, Earth's moon is the only place beyond Earth where humans have set foot.</p> <br>
        <h1>Stars</h1>
        <p>Stars are the most widely recognized astronomical objects, and represent the most fundamental building blocks of galaxies. The age, distribution, and composition of the stars in a galaxy trace the history, dynamics, and evolution of that galaxy. Moreover, stars are responsible for the manufacture and distribution of heavy elements such as carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and their characteristics are intimately tied to the characteristics of the planetary systems that may coalesce about them. Consequently, the study of the birth, life, and death of stars is central to the field of astronomy.</p> <br>
        <h1>Mountains</h1>
        <p>They define landscapes, people risk their lives to climb them, and they can even make their own weather.</p> <br>
        <h1>river </h1>
        <p>a natural wide flow of fresh water across the land into the sea, a lake, or another river:</p> <br>
        <h1>Boat</h1>
        <p>A boat is a watercraft of a large range of types and sizes, but generally smaller than a ship, which is distinguished by its larger size, shape, cargo or passenger capacity, or its ability to carry boats.</p> <br>
